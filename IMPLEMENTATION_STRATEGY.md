## Data Ingestion Process

### Overview

The data ingestion process populates our knowledge base with information from various sources that power our clean tech ecosystem assistant. This data includes company information, educational resources, climate reports, and career pathways.

### Data Sources

1. **Company Resources**: Websites and documentation from ACT member companies
2. **Climate Reports**: PDF documents containing industry analysis and workforce needs
3. **Educational Resources**: Training program information and curriculum details
4. **Career Pathways**: Structured career progression paths in clean energy sectors

### Ingestion Workflow

The data ingestion process follows these steps:

1. **Data Source Preparation**
   - Company data structured in `constants.py`
   - PDF reports stored in a designated `reports` directory
   - External URLs organized by category and company

2. **Crawling & Processing**
   - Web crawling for all company resources using an approach similar to crawl4ai
   - PDF parsing for report documents using document loaders
   - HTML content extraction and cleaning
   - Smart chunking to preserve contextual meaning

3. **Vector Embedding Generation**
   - Generating embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model (1536 dimensions)
   - Associating rich metadata with each embedded chunk

4. **Supabase Storage**
   - Storing documents with embeddings in Supabase's pgvector-enabled tables
   - Including all relevant metadata for filtering and retrieval

5. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Tracking ingestion status for each company and resource
   - Persisting status to JSON files to support incremental updates
   - URL-based deduplication to prevent redundant content

### Implementation Details

The `data_ingestion.py` tool will:

1. Load company information from the updated `constants.py` file
2. Check which companies/resources have already been indexed
3. Process unindexed companies in batches
4. For each company:
   - Crawl all resources listed in their profile
   - Extract relevant content
   - Generate chunks appropriate for semantic search
   - Create embeddings
   - Store in Supabase with company metadata
   - Mark as indexed to prevent future duplication
5. Process PDF reports similarly, with specialized chunking for structured documents
6. Save indexing status after processing to support incremental updates

This process allows for adding new companies or updating existing company information without creating duplicates in the knowledge base.

### Integration with RAG System

The indexed knowledge will power our Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system:

1. User queries will be converted to embeddings
2. Embeddings will be used to search the vector store in Supabase
3. Most relevant content will be retrieved and used to generate accurate, contextualized responses
4. Company and resource metadata will enable targeted searches for specific domains or topics

By maintaining an up-to-date and comprehensive knowledge base, our assistant will provide accurate, relevant information about the Massachusetts clean tech ecosystem.

## User Assessment Process

The user assessment process is a critical component for personalizing recommendations. It follows these steps:

### 1. Initial User Type Identification

Users are presented with a simple questionnaire to identify their background:

```
Which best describes your current situation?
- [ ] Military veteran or transitioning service member
- [ ] International professional with foreign credentials
- [ ] Student (vocational/community college/university)
- [ ] Career changer from another industry
- [ ] Current clean energy professional seeking advancement
- [ ] Massachusetts resident from an Environmental Justice community
```

### 2. Targeted Follow-up Questions

Based on the user type, 2-3 targeted questions are presented:

**For Veterans:**
- How recently did you transition from military service?
- What was your primary military occupational specialty (MOS)?
- What clean energy sector are you most interested in?

**For International Professionals:**
- In which country did you obtain your credentials?
- What is your professional field of expertise?
- Have you had your credentials evaluated in the US?

**For Students:**
- What type of educational institution are you attending?
- What is your field of study?
- When do you expect to complete your program?

**For Career Changers:**
- What industry are you transitioning from?
- What skills from your current role do you believe are transferable?
- Are you currently employed?

### 3. Resume Collection

Users are prompted to:
- Upload their resume (PDF, DOCX, or TXT format)
- Or paste the text of their resume directly
- Optionally provide LinkedIn profile URL for additional information

### 4. Profile Creation

The system:
1. Parses the resume to extract key information
2. Combines resume data with questionnaire responses
3. Creates a comprehensive user profile stored in Supabase
4. Identifies skill sets, experience level, and background
5. For veterans, translates military skills to civilian equivalents

### 5. Personalized Recommendations

Based on the user profile, the system provides:
- **Job Recommendations**: From our partner companies matching their skills and interests
- **Skill Gap Analysis**: Identifying skills needed for desired roles
- **Educational Pathways**: Courses, certifications, or programs to close skill gaps
- **Career Transition Guidance**: Personalized roadmaps based on their background
- **Company Connections**: Introducing companies with relevant opportunities

This assessment process ensures all recommendations are tailored to the user's specific background and needs, while focusing exclusively on opportunities within our partner ecosystem.
